                    <p>Cats only pretend to have bones. They are in fact a sentient (occasionally malicious) liquid! Observing cats for any period of time makes this abundantly clear. In 2017, Marc-Antoin Fardin, a researcher of rheology at Universit√© Paris Diderot - USPC, took home the Ig Nobel Prize for his work on the fluid nature of cats(<a href="https://theconversation.com/answering-the-question-that-won-me-the-ig-nobel-prize-are-cats-liquid-86589" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Reference Article, The Conversation</a>), and yet, still!, the world has not awakened to these duplicitous fuzzy creatures.</p>
                    <p>Veterinarians have tried to prove that cats are in fact solid, and have bones like other mammals. Indeed x-ray examinations seem to show skeletal structure, but this is a lie! Cats modify their internal structure to create the appearance and function of bones whenever they are required, but it is crystal clear that they cannot possibly actually have skeletons.</p>

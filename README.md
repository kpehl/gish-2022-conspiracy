# GISH August 2022, Item 59

## Project Description

Thanks to whistleblower Kendrick Smith, we all know that [birds aren't real](https://birdsarentreal.com/). But that's not all They have been lying to us about. Dragonflies are surveillance micro-drones! There's only one mushroom in the entire world, connected through an underground, wifi-enabled mushroom networkâ€¦ and it's listening to us! Octopi are aliens! Build a website that uncovers the Truth that is out there on a specific conspiracy that the world was previously unaware of. Submit a screenshot of the site and send us a link to your website in the comments.
